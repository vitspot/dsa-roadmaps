## Move Zeroes
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 


Example 1:
```
    Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
    Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

Example 2:
```
    Input: nums = [0]
    Output: [0]
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
```
