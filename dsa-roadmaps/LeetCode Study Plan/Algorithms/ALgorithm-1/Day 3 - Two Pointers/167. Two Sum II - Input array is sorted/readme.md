## Two Sum II - Input Array is sorted
### Problem Statement
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= first < second <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

 


Example 1:
```
    Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [1,2]
    Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

```

Example 2:
```
    Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,3]
    Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3.
```

Example 3:
```
    Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
    Output: [1,2]
    Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

Constraints:
```
    2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
    -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
    numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    -1000 <= target <= 1000
    The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
```
