## Remove Nth Node From End of List
### Problem Statement
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

 


Example 1:
```
    Input: head = [1], n = 1
    Output: []

```

Example 2:
```
    Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
    Output: [1]
```

Constraints:
```
    The number of nodes in the list is sz.
    1 <= sz <= 30
    0 <= Node.val <= 100
    1 <= n <= sz
```
