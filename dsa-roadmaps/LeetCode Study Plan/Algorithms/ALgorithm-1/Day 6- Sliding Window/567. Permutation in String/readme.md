## Permutation in String
### Problem Statement
Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.

In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

 


Example 1:
```
    Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
    Output: true
    Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

```

Example 2:
```
    Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
    Output: false
```

Constraints:
```
    1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 104
    s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
```
