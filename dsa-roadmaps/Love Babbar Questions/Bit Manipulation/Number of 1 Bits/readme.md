## Number of 1 Bits
Given a positive integer N, print count of set bits in it. 

 

Example 1:
```C
Input:
N = 6
Output:
2
Explanation:
Binary representation is '110' 
So the count of the set bit is 2.
```

Example 2:
```C
Input:
8
Output:
1
Explanation:
Binary representation is '1000' 
So the count of the set bit is 1.
```
Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
