The N - Queens problem is to place n - queens in such a manner on an n x n chessboard that no queens attack each other by being in the same row, column or diagonal.

Time complexity: Its time complexity is far better than the iterative approach as it prevents some cases because of the use of isSafe function.
Auxilary space: O(N2) 

Contraints:
n>3
As no trivial solution exists for inputs 1,2 and 3
