## Problem statement
Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars. For simplicity, assume that all bars have the same width and the width is 1 unit, there will be N bars height of each bar will be given by the array arr.

## Example
```
Input:
N = 8
arr[] = {7 2 8 9 1 3 6 5}
Output: 16
Explanation: Maximum size of the histogram will be 8  and there will be 2 consecutive 
histogram. And hence the area of the histogram will be 8x2 = 16.
```

## Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^12
