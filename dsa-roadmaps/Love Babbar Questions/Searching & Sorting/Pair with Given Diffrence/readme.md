Given an array Arr[] of size L and a number N, you need to write a program to find if there exists a pair of elements in the array whose difference is N.

Example 1:

Input:
L = 6, N = 78
arr[] = {5, 20, 3, 2, 5, 80}
Output: 1
Explanation: (2, 80) have difference of 78.
Example 2:

Input:
L = 5, N = 45
arr[] = {90, 70, 20, 80, 50}
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no pair with difference of 45.
Your Task:
You need not take input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findPair() which takes array arr, size of the array L and N as input parameters and returns True if required pair exists, else return False.
