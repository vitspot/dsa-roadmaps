Given an array A[ ] of positive integers of size N, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among M students such that :
1. Each student gets exactly one packet.
2. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum.

You don't need to take any input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMinDiff() which takes array A[ ], N and M as input parameters and returns the minimum possible difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
1 ≤ M ≤ N
