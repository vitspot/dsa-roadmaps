Given a string S of distinct character of size N and their corresponding frequency f[ ] i.e. character S[i] has f[i] frequency. Your task is to build the Huffman tree print all the huffman codes in preorder traversal of the tree.
Note: If two elements have same frequency, then the element which occur at first will be taken on the left of Binary Tree and other one to the right.

Example 1:

S = "abcdef"
f[] = {5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 45}
Output: 
0 100 101 1100 1101 111
Explanation:
HuffmanCodes will be:
f : 0
c : 100
d : 101
a : 1100
b : 1101
e : 111
Hence printing them in the PreOrder of Binary 
Tree.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function huffmanCodes() which takes the given string S, frequency array f[ ] and number of characters N as input parameters and returns a vector of strings containing all huffman codes in order of preorder traversal of the tree.
