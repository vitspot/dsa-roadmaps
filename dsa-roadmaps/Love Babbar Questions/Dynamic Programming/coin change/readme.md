Given a value N, find the number of ways to make change for N cents, if we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , SM } valued coins.

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function count() which accepts an array S[] its size m and n as input parameter and returns the number of ways to make change for N cents.


Expected Time Complexity: O(m*n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).
