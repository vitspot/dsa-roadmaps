Given a binary tree, find its level order traversal.
Level order traversal of a tree is breadth-first traversal for the tree.


Example 1:

Input:
    1
  /   \ 
 3     2
Output:1 3 2
Example 2:

Input:
        10
     /      \
    20       30
  /   \
 40   60
Output:10 20 30 40 60 N N

Your Task:
You don't have to take any input. Complete the function levelOrder() that takes the root node as input parameter and returns a list of integers containing the level order traversal of the given Binary Tree.
