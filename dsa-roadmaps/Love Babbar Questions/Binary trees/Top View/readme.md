    /     \
   2       3
  /  \    /   \
4    5  6   7

Top view will be: 4 2 1 3 7
Note: Return nodes from leftmost node to rightmost node.

Example 1:

        Input:
            1
        /    \
        2      3
        Output: 2 1 3
        
Example 2:

        Input:
            10
            /      \
        20        30
        /   \    /    \
        40   60  90    100
