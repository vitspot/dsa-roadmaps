Given an array of integers and a positive integer k, determine the number of (i, j) pairs where i < j and ar[i] + ar[j] is divisible by k.
Complete the divisibleSumPairs function in the editor below.

divisibleSumPairs has the following parameter(s):

int n: the length of array 
int ar[n]: an array of integers
int k: the integer divisor

The first line contains 2 space-separated integers, n and k.
The second line contains n space-separated integers, each a value of arr[i].
